This repository contains Rust packages for handling the REST API for `snapd`. This is current manually maintained, due to a lack of a way to auto-generate a wrapper, and may not work on new `snapd` releases if the semi-stable API has changed. 

For general details, including installation, getting started and setting up a development environment, head over to our section on [Contributing to the code](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-code).

## Setup

To test this, you'll need Rust installed (use [https://rustup.rs]), as well as a local, current of `snapd`. All tests can be run via `cargo test`.
